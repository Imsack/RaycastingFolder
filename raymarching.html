    <h2>Creating a 3D engine using Raymarching</h2>

    <p>
      Raymarching is a technique very similar to raycasting, although instead of
      casting 2D rays into a 2D scene, we cast <i>3D rays</i> represented as
      vectors into a <i>3D scene</i>. To be more precise, each ray is casted
      from an origin point (often referred to as the camera or player) to a
      plane some distance away from the origin point creating a pyramid-like
      structure of rays. Each ray is set to correspond with a pixel on the
      screen (the top-left most ray corresponding to the top-left most pixel and
      so on). If a ray intersects with an object in the scene we then color the
      pixel corresponding to the ray using information from the intersection.
    </p>
    <h2>Finding intersections</h2>
    <p>
      The procedure used to find intersections with raymarching is similar to
      the one used for raycasting. Although before going over it we must first
      be able to represent 3D objects in 3D space. For primitive objects like
      spheres or planes there are equations we can use for this.

    <p>
      For more advanced objects this is usually more difficult though, so the
      solution is often to describe the object as being made up of more simly
      objects like planes.<br />
      <br />
      Once we are able to represent objects in space we need a way to search for
      intersections with the objects and the rays. We can do this by making use
      of a function known as a "Distance estimator". The distance estimator
      finds the distance between a specified point on the ray and an object in
      the scene. For complicated shapes we find the distance between every
      simple shape that makes it up and then take the smallest of those
      distances. Once we have this distance we can move the point on the ray
      forward by that distance and measure the new distance from the object.
      This is done recursively until the distance is less than some value used
      to decide what counts as an intersection. This type of distance estimating
      is known as "spheretracing".
